# shellscript

This provides a basic framework for a bash script, with argument parsing 
and various other handling of the commandline.  It also provides a few 
useful functions for the script. 

To use, copy and replace the actual functioning code at the bottom.

While there are two different command argument parsers, and they warn
you to only use one, if you leave them both in place, your script will
work fine... but you'll be confused later when you come back to edit
your script a year later.
